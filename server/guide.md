You've probably landed here because you are interested in using DeathMarkers to **improve** the gameplay/experience in the levels you create. **Great!** That's exactly what the mod was made to do.

As you (probably) know by now, this mod collects **every player's deaths** with a heck of a lot of information. With these statistics, you can find out more about how players experience your level and iron out any **unintended unfair/blind jumps**.

This stuff is not self-explanatory, though. Which is why this document walks you through **the interface(s)** that the mod offers to creators, as well as a guide on **interpreting** the data to make an impact on your levels.
