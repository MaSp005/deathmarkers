# DeathMarkers

**Online death collection**, not only for fun <cy>Mario Maker-style Death Markers</c>,
but also for <cg>in-depth analysis of gameplay</c>.

**Features:**
- Show <cy>other players' deaths</c> when you die
- Analyze player deaths in your levels
- Help creators <cg>improve</c> their levels

**Planned Features:** (who knows if these ever get done lmao)
- Built-in analysis <cg>helper tools</c>
- (minimal) Player path tracing

## Disclaimer

The mod makes use of your *username and user ID* to create an identifier for you. <cg>This identifier **can not be traced back to you**</c>; it is unique to you for the purpose of grouping together attempts (/deaths) that were from the same player. Your identifier is *different* for every level you play, so your deaths *cannot* be grouped together across levels.

You can <cr>prevent</c> the mod from sharing your deaths and still show others' deaths in the settings, although it is recommended to <cg>keep (anonymous) sharing on</c> for creators seeking to use the data to improve their levels.

## Special Thanks

**Adam_729** for creating the [original mod](https://github.com/Adam7290/deathmarkers)! As this is my first mod, a lot of the original source code helped me figure out the process of modding with Geode.
